   *About Christie:*
   Agatha Mary Clarissa, Lady Mallowan, DBE (15 September 1890 - 12 January 1976), commonly known as Agatha Christie, was
   an English crime fiction writer. She also wrote romance novels under the name Mary Westmacott, but is best remembered
   for her 80 detective novels and her successful West End theatre plays. Her works, particularly featuring detectives
   Hercule Poirot or Miss Jane Marple, have given her the title the 'Queen of Crime' and made her one of the most important
   and innovative writers in the development of the genre. Christie has been called - by the Guinness Book of World
   Records, among others - the best-selling writer of books of all time, and the best-selling writer of any kind together
   with William Shakespeare. Only the Bible sold more with about 6 billion copies. An estimated four billion copies of her
   novels have been sold. UNESCO states that she is currently the most translated individual author in the world with only
   the collective corporate works of Walt Disney Productions superseding her. As an example of her broad appeal, she is the
   all-time best-selling author in France, with over 40 million copies sold in French (as of 2003) versus 22 million for
   Emile Zola, the nearest contender. Her stage play, The Mousetrap, holds the record for the longest initial run in the
   world, opening at the Ambassadors Theatre in London on 25 November 1952, and as of 2007 is still running after more than
   20,000 performances. In 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America's highest honor, the
   Grand Master Award, and in the same year, Witness for the Prosecution was given an Edgar Award by the MWA, for Best
   Play. Most of her books and short stories have been filmed, some many times over (Murder on the Orient Express, Death on
   the Nile, 4.50 From Paddington), and many have been adapted for television, radio, video games and comics. In 1998, the
   control of the rights to most of the literary works of Agatha Christie passed to the company Chorion, when it purchased
   a majority 64% share in Agatha Christie Limited. Source: Wikipedia

** Chapter 1 I GO TO STYLES

   The intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the time as "The Styles Case" has now somewhat subsided.
   Nevertheless, in view of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked, both by my friend Poirot and the
   family themselves, to write an account of the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the sensational
   rumours which still persist.

   I will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my being connected with the affair.

   I had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some months in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was
   given a month's sick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make up my mind what to do, when I ran
   across John Cavendish. I had seen very little of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him particularly well. He
   was a good fifteen years my senior, for one thing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy, though, I had
   often stayed at Styles, his mother's place in Essex.

   We had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me down to Styles to spend my leave there.

   "The mater will be delighted to see you again-after all those years," he added.

   "Your mother keeps well?" I asked.

   "Oh, yes. I suppose you know that she has married again?"

   I am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish, who had married John's father when he was a widower
   with two sons, had been a handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could not be a day less than
   seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic, autocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social
   notoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady Bountiful. She was a most generous woman, and
   possessed a considerable fortune of her own.

   Their country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish early in their married life. He had been
   completely under his wife's ascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her lifetime, as well as
   the larger part of his income; an arrangement that was distinctly unfair to his two sons. Their step-mother, however,
   had always been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the time of their father's remarriage that they
   always thought of her as their own mother.

   Lawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. He had qualified as a doctor but early relinquished the profession of
   medicine, and lived at home while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any marked success.

   John practiced for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled down to the more congenial life of a country
   squire. He had married two years ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though I entertained a shrewd suspicion
   that he would have preferred his mother to increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home of his
   own. Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her own plans, and expected other people to fall in with
   them, and in this case she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.

   John noticed my surprise at the news of his mother's remarriage and smiled rather ruefully.

   "Rotten little bounder too!" he said savagely. "I can tell you, Hastings, it's making life jolly difficult for us. As
   for Evie-you remember Evie?"

   "No."

   "Oh, I suppose she was after your time. She's the mater's factotum, companion, Jack of all trades! A great sport-old
   Evie! Not precisely young and beautiful, but as game as they make them."

   "You were going to say-?"

   "Oh, this fellow! He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a second cousin or something of Evie's, though she
   didn't seem particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is an absolute outsider, anyone can see that.
   He's got a great black beard, and wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottoned to him at once,
   took him on as secretary-you know how she's always running a hundred societies?"

   I nodded.
